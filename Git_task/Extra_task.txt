Extra task

1) What is 'git stash' and how to use it?
Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory.
The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
The modifications list: 'git stash list', inspect: 'git stash show', and restore: 'git stash apply'

2) What is 'git reset' and when we shouldn't use it?
It undid your last commit, the git add and git commit commands, and all the work you did in your working directory (it is a permanent undo).
 It can be used to remove committed snapshots, although it’s more often used to undo changes in the staging area and the working directory.
 In either case, it should only be used to undo local changes—you should never reset snapshots that have been shared with other developers.

3) When we need cherry-pick, and how does it happens?
is take a commit from somewhere else, and "play it back" wherever you are right now.
Because this introduces the same change with a different parent, Git builds a new commit with a different ID.

4)What does do 'git rm ..' command and what not?
Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory.
